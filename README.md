<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures rep</h1>

<p>This repository contains materials from the Warsaw University of Technology course. Exercises done during this course include code provided by the instructor,
the tasks were to analyze and modify given implementations or add your own. Exercise 5 was an independent task, which was to implement compression and decompression of text files.</p>
